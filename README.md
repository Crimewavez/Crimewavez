# Welcome to My GitHub!

Here, you can read about my **life story**, marvel at the *amazing* languages I pretend to know, and skim through **shameless plugs** of my *unsuccessful* development blogs. All of this while you are assaulted by an overwhelming number of emojis. 🎉🎨💥
This is the most interesting thing you’ll ever read in your life. Seriously. No need to thank me. 😉

I started my programming journey *many years ago*. I was a **tiny boy** with a dream. From there, I “grew” into the average, totally uninspired coder you see before you.

- *Insert tons of links to my generic blog posts about topics I have no idea about.*
- 
- *Insert tons of links to my social media accounts because I'm tottaly worth of following.*

- *Pretty graph, so you can get impressed.*
