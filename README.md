# Welcome to My GitHub!

Here, you can read about my **life story**, marvel at the *amazing* languages I pretend to know, and skim through **shameless plugs** of my *unsuccessful* development blogs. All of this while you are assaulted by an overwhelming number of emojis. 🎉🎨💥
This is the most interesting thing you’ll ever read in your life. Seriously. No need to thank me. 😉
